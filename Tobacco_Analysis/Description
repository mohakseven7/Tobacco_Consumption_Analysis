# AI-Powered Insights & Analysis on Youth Tobacco Survey Data

## **Project Overview**
This project leverages data science and AI techniques to analyze and generate insights from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS-4) dataset. Using data visualization and NLP-based models, it provides valuable observations about tobacco usage among youth in different states of India.

## **Key Features**
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handling missing data to maintain analysis integrity.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visualization of the top states with the highest percentage of current tobacco users.

3. **NLP-Based Insights:**
   - Generating concise textual insights for each state using a text summarization model.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data visualization
  - `transformers`: NLP models for text summarization

## **Installation Instructions**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Tobacco_Usage_Insights_Project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Tobacco_Usage_Insights_Project
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **How to Run**
1. Ensure the dataset is available in the project directory.
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python gyts_ai_project.py
   ```
3. View generated insights and visualizations.

## **Sample Outputs**
### **Visualization:**
- Bar chart of the top 10 states with the highest tobacco usage.

### **Generated Insight:**
- "In State X, 35% have ever used tobacco, and 22% are current users."

## **Project Insights**
- Highlighted states requiring stronger anti-tobacco interventions.
- Automated insight generation to assist public health policymakers.
